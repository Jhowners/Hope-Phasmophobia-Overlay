> **🩸 v1.4 UPDATE:** Full support for **Blood Moon** (Event Speed Math), **Discord Rich Presence (RPC)**, and 6 new languages including French, German, and Ukrainian!

**Stop fighting your memory. Start fighting the Ghost.**

Phasmophobia is a game of cognitive endurance. When a Revenant starts hunting, your brain shifts into "Fight or Flight." In that split second, trying to mentally calculate footstep speed or remember Smudge cooldowns adds **Cognitive Load**—mental friction that causes hesitation and errors.

**Hope Phasmophobia Overlay** acts as your "Second Brain." It floats directly over your game, offloading data processing so you can maintain 100% focus on survival.

## 🧠 The Science of "Flow"
Every time you Alt-Tab to a wiki or look at a second monitor, you suffer from **Context Switching Penalty**. Your brain takes milliseconds to refocus—time you don't have during an Apocalypse Run.

HPO keeps you in the **Flow State** by using:
* **Pre-Attentive Processing:** Evidence cards glow with specific colors (🔴 Red = EMF 5, 🔵 Cyan = Freezing). Your brain recognizes these patterns instantly without needing to read text.
* **Muscle Memory Input:** Toggle evidence via global hotkeys (`Alt+1` through `Alt+7`) without ever unlocking your mouse or stopping your movement.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Deduction Engine
Don't guess. Know.
* **Winter's Jest Ready:** Full logic for **Obambo**, **Gallu**, and **Dayan**.
* **Frictionless Filtering:** As you mark evidence via hotkeys, the ghost list filters instantly.
* **Smart Logic:** Marking "Normal Speed" on the Pacer automatically eliminates the Revenant. Marking "Ghost Orb" eliminates the Mimic (unless you flag it as a Fake Orb).

### 2. The Ghost Pacer (BPM) + Blood Moon 🩸
* **Rhythm Entrainment:** Tap `F10` to the sound of the ghost's footsteps.
* **Dynamic Speed Analysis:** The app calculates the BPM and cross-references it with your evidence list.
* **Event Support:** Select **"Blood Moon (+15%)"** from the speed dropdown to automatically adjust math for the faster event ghosts.

### 3. Discord Rich Presence (RPC) 🎮
* **Live Status:** Automatically displays your current investigation status on Discord.
* **Real-Time Info:** Shows "Searching for Evidence," "Chasing (2.5 m/s)," or "Identified: Demon" to your friends.
* *Privacy Mode:* Can be toggled off instantly via the Right-Click menu.

### 4. Three Tactical Modes
* **📖 Analysis Mode:** Full journal view for the van or safe spots.
* **🧠 Intel Mode [HOME]:** A compact, peripheral HUD designed for looping. Shows only vital stats without blocking your vision.
* **⏱️ Survival Mode [PAUSE/BREAK]:** Strips the UI down to just the Timer. Zero distractions for the heat of the chase.

1. Go to the **[Releases Page](../../releases)**.
2. Download the latest `.zip` file.
3. Extract the folder to your desktop (Do not run from inside the zip).

## 👨‍💻 For Developers (Portfolio Note)
This project demonstrates:
* **WPF & XAML:** Complex UI binding, transparent window layering, and dynamic resource dictionaries for localization.
* **DiscordRPC:** Integration of external APIs for rich user presence.
* **P/Invoke (User32.dll):** Implementation of Global Low-Level Keyboard Hooks for hotkey detection outside the application focus.
* **MVVM Architecture:** Clean separation of logic and UI using `INotifyPropertyChanged`.
* **Multi-Threading:** High-priority dispatcher timers to ensure UI responsiveness during heavy game load.
